1. [x] Add a numStrings property and getNumStrings() method to GuitarSpec.java.
2. Modify Guitar.java so that the properties of GuitarSpec are encapsulated away from the constructor of the class.

3. Change the search() method in Inventory.java to delegate comparing the two GuitarSpec objects to the GuitarSpec class, instead of handling the comparison directly.

4. Update FindGuitarTester.java to work with your new classes, and make sure everything still works.

5. Compare your answers with ours on page 44, and then get ready for another test drive to see if weâ€™ve finally got this application finished.
